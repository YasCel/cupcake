  <p>Portland’s only exclusively handcrafted cupcakes are fresh baked daily in the Pearl District since 2007 using locally sourced natural ingredients—right down to the candied rose petals and fresh lemon curd toppings. From everyday favorites to seasonal specials, we’ve got a cupcake you’ll crave daily (including gluten free & vegan cupcakes).</p>

  <p>Make the world a sweeter place. One cupcake at a time.</p>
  <p>Dive into a bit of cupcake culture and come up with ideas of your own: inspiration for weddings, business gatherings and special occasions.</p>
